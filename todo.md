# To do (students): 
1. **Pull** this repository (or the latest changes) to your computer. 
3. Change the **form-and-data** project in the following way:
a) The home page asks for two things: 1) a **message** 2) a **number**
b) When you press the button, the target page is opened and it shows the *message* repeated *number* of times, always separated by a line break ("\n").
4. When everything works, **push** your work to the cloud.
